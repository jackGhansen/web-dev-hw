The Internet is more or less the general notion of networks connecting to other networks while the web is the specific (www.) that you can access Information from.
You have routers which come with an ID address which links to the router of the internet, network to network I guess, then your router is link to you computer or phone or what have you (Wifi) then you are connected to the server which allows you access.
 Directory is like a file cabinet, its the structure that contains references to other files. You use the Directory to navigate through files and other files and so on.
 It is when the files go through many revisions, it's important because then documents can easily be changed. 
 I didn't know what VCS was, nor how to take a screenshot on my PC haha. Also sing this github site was rather challenging, but something quite new.
