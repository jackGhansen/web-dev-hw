I visted Myspace 2004, this site brought me back to when I was in my firends basement listening to music and thinking this was the coolest thing ever. I never had a myspace account, but it was cool to see how primitive it was. One I am not sure if myspace is a thing anymore, but the web page it self is very dated and not like facebook or any site today.
