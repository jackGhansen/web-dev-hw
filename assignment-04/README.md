I visted Myspace 2004, this site brought me back to when I was in my firends basement listening to music and thinking this was the coolest thing ever. I never had a myspace account, but it was cool to see how primitive it was. One I am not sure if myspace is a thing anymore, but the web page it self is very dated and not like facebook or any site today.

My experince with GIT Module, has been very challenging, I am lost, not sure what I'm doing. I had to do youtube videos and contact other members of the class. I think this class would be much better if in was in class rather then online. The walkthroghs are not that helpful and just overall confusing. At first the Git desktop app did not take my file, it wasnt until I did everything in Atom then it went to the GIT thing which then I didnt know what to do with it, so I did nothing. Did everything in Github and Atom, not quite sure what GIT desktop thing does.
